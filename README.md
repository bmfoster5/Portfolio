## Description

Hello! Welcome to my portfolio website where I will be uploading my future work as I enter into the computer science field!

- My motivation for this project is to showcase my future projects to potential employers. In addition, I want future employers to know where I have come from and what I will be working towards in the future. 
- I learned that coding through CSS and HTML, I can create a well presented and easily manuverable website that can showcase my current and future projects.
